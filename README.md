# LiteFlowNet2
This repository (<strong>https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet2</strong>) is the offical release of <strong>LiteFlowNet2</strong> for my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07414.pdf"><strong>A Lightweight Optical Flow CNN - Revisiting Data Fidelity and Regularization</strong></a>. 

LiteFlowNet2, another lightweight convolutional network, is evolved from our earlier work in CVPR 2018 (<strong>https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet</strong>) to better address the problem of optical flow estimation by improving flow accuracy and computation time.
